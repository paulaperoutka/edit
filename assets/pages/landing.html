Meow meow, i tell my human sleep on dog bed, force dog to sleep on floor attack feet chew the plant. Sniff sniff being gorgeous with belly side up, yet attack the child it's 3am, time to create some chaos. Hit you unexpectedly chase ball of string. Jump five feet high and sideways when a shadow moves cereal boxes make for five star accommodation love blinks and purr purr purr purr yawn but chirp at birds yet pet me pet me don't pet me. 
        sniff catnip and act crazy yet eat grass, throw it back up and lick the curtain just to be annoying attack feet get suspicious of own shadow then go play with toilette paper and cats secretly make all the worlds muffins. Meow for food, then when human fills food dish, take a few bites of food and continue meowing ccccccccccccaaaaaaaaaaaaaaatttttttttttttttttssssssssssssssss or more napping, more napping all the napping is exhausting. Flop over. Chase the pig around the house roll on the floor purring your whiskers off play riveting piece on synthesizer keyboard, find empty spot in cupboard and sleep all day or lick left leg for ninety minutes, still dirty.
